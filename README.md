#Hello!  
#Here are three projects that I would like to present.

#1. Project1 a.k.a 'Gardening'
Have you ever forgotten to water a plant? It happens to me every time.
This programm will help you to understand when you should water your plants, whether it be a rose, a carnation or any other flower.

#2. Project2 a.k.a 'Workout schedule'
This programm creates a fancy table with your schedule for the week according to the chosen routine for each day.

#3. Project3 a.k.a 'Radio'
With this you can listen to different genres of music on radio.
