# Hello!
# Here are three projects that I would like to present.

# 1. Project1 a.k.a 'Gardening'
Have you ever forgotten to water a plant? It happens to me every time.
This programm will help you to understand when you should water your plants, whether it be a rose, a carnation or any other flower.
It provides you with a choice: which flower is in question.
Then the program tells you the today's date and how often should you water this exact type of flower.
And after that it will propose to create a two week watering schedule for today's date or any other possible date. 
If you answer 'yes' then it will carry on, if you input anything else, the program will stop.
The programm exits with a goodbye and waits for client to press something before closing the console's window.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the data will be input wrong, the programm automatically will make a schedule from today's date and finish the work. 

# 2. Project2 a.k.a 'Workout schedule'
This programm creates a fancy table with your schedule for the week according to the chosen routine for each day.
You are provided with a choice of routines and the programm will ask you about each day to input the routine.

# 3. Project3 a.k.a 'Radio'
With this you can listen to different genres of music on *radio*.
There is a switch included which helps to indicate the choice through number's input.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The whole thing is in a loop and will give you a choice untill you decide to turn off the radio. 

# Hopefully, it was fun! Have a nice day.
